# AI 与 Cyber Security

## 为何目前不少公司开始致力于研究人工智能、自动化地网络安全工具？

关注信息资产安全的组织、企业和黑客们在过去数十年中，对可用数据的争夺从未放松过，这是一场持久的战争。近几年，我们发现很多信息技术创新都与网络安全相关。而体现这些创新的许多重要的工具都与人工智能相关。这一趋势将持续下去，如果你想在安全领域赶上这一浪潮，你需要构建一个基于机器学习的系统。

趋势体现于以下几点：
- 人工智能系统将广泛应用于网络防御和网络攻击。
- 使用自动化来加强密码
- Biometric 安全将是非常重要的趋势
- 云计算将成为企业的一大安全隐患、漏洞


## 案例 2018年震惊世界的5起基于AI的攻击

2018年，基于机器学习系统的Botnet 攻击和投毒已经成为一种趋势。人工智能技术已经被用于恶意代码和僵尸网络，能够更加有效的攻击数据和设备。

虽然人工智能僵尸网络帮助黑客进入设备并执行分布式拒绝服务攻击而不被发现，通过人工智能对机器学习系统进行毒害一直是黑客们的一项艰巨任务，因为首先获得对ML系统的访问权，然后毒害其机器学习过程，通过注入特洛伊木马对其工作造成干扰，这是一项乏味的工作。下面列举了5个由AI促成的攻击：

### TaskRabbit

The online marketplace for labourers and clients 面临着大量的网络安全攻击。这个网站有 3.75 million 用户受影响，大量数据被盗取。网站一度被迫关停。

### Nokia

According to the Threat intelligence report published by the company, the internet of things (IoT) botnet activity is responsible for 78% of malware detection in networks. In 2016, the rate of botnet attacks was 33%. Android devices like Nokia were responsible for 47.15% of malware infections. It was also found that malware has infected many crypto-currency systems which have thus caused issues in crypto-coin mining. The AI botnets often look for vulnerability in devices, after which they exploit the system to discover chief elements and then attack the target, the malware is detected only after the target has been attacked and data has been stolen.

WordPress
The WordPress security has recently declared a massive Botnet attack on its sites. According to reports, 20,000 sites under WordPress have been infected with the cyber attack. The attack was created by a botnet, under which the malicious servers attacked through a Russian proxy provider under the name “best-proxies.ru”. This provider was attached to a network of 14,000 proxy servers which then infected 20,000 WordPress sites. The Defiant threat intelligence team investigated the matter and found the botnet attack. The brute force attack data was identified by the team and later on, it matched with “best-proxies.ru”. The attack infrastructure and the brute force attack campaign has been identified by “Defiant”. Unaffected users have been warned to implement restrictions and lockout for failed logins, to save their sites.

Marriott Scam
In November, the luxury hotel brand exposed a breach in its reservation system. The hackers gained access to the system of many of its hotel chains. This breach affected its 500 million customers. Information like names, credit card numbers, passport numbers, addresses and phone numbers were compromised due to this breach. According to reports, this breach has affected Marriott for four years. The breach was flagged after an internal security tool managed to detect an unauthorized party’s activity in September. The party had first gained access to the information, they encrypted it and then tried to remove it. It took the investigation team two months to decrypt the information. Recently, many US investigators are blaming Chinese state hackers. Reports suggest the breach was executed by hackers affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

Instagram
One of the most popular social media applications came under cyber attack twice this year. In August, hundreds of Instagram users took to Twitter and other social media to report about the attack on the site. Many of the users were logged out of their accounts, account information like name, password and phone number was changed by the hackers. According to reports, when the users reported the incident on the help page. Instagram didn’t respond to their complaints regarding their hacked accounts.
