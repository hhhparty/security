# 渗透测试报告（模板） 

执行技术性的评测仅是全面安全测试的一部分。安全测试的最终产品是一份完备的、富含信息的报告。报告应该易于理解且突出所有评测中发现的风险。报告应当同时面向执行管理者和技术专员。

报告需要有3个主要部分（章节），且应以一贯的风格编写，方便每个独立部分的单独打印和提交给适当的团队，例如开发者或系统管理员。我们推荐由以下内容组成各部分：
- 执行概述
  - 存在哪些问题？
  - 如何修复、补救？（一页纸）
- 测试参数
  - 项目目标
  - 项目范围
  - 项目规划
  - 目标
  - 限定/约束
  - 发现问题总结
  - 补救方法总结
- 发现的问题
  - 截屏和命令行
  - 受影响项目
  - 问题和受影响功能或对象的技术描述
  - 解决问题的方法
  - 严重性排序，如果使用CVSS那么要有向量名称
  - 使用check list。
- 附件


## 安全测试执行概述 Executive Summary
The executive summary sums up the overall findings of the assessment and gives business managers and system owners a high level view of the vulnerabilities discovered. The language used should be more suited to people who are not technically aware and should include graphs or other charts which show the risk level. Keep in mind that executives will likely only have time to read this summary and will want two questions answered in plain language:

What's wrong?
How do I fix it? You have one page to answer these questions.
The executive summary should plainly state that the vulnerabilities and their severity is an input to their organizational risk management process, not an outcome or remediation. It is safest to explain that tester does not understand the threats faced by the organization or business consequences if the vulnerabilities are exploited. This is the job of the risk professional who calculates risk levels based on this and other information. Risk management will typically be part of the organization's IT Security Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) regime and this report will simply provide an input to that process.

## 安全测试参数 Test Parameters
The Introduction should outline the parameters of the security testing, the findings and remediation. Some suggested section headings include:

2.1 Project Objective: This section outlines the project objectives and the expected outcome of the assessment.

2.2 Project Scope: This section outlines the agreed scope.

2.3 Project Schedule: This section outlines when the testing commenced and when it was completed.

2.4 Targets: This section lists the number of applications or targeted systems.

2.5 Limitations: This section outlines every limitation which was faced throughout the assessment. For example, limitations of project-focused tests, limitation in the security testing methods, performance or technical issues that the tester come across during the course of assessment, etc.

2.6 Findings Summary: This section outlines the vulnerabilities that were discovered during testing.

2.7 Remediation Summary: This section outlines the action plan for fixing the vulnerabilities that were discovered during testing.

## 安全测试发现的问题 Findings
The last section of the report includes detailed technical information about the vulnerabilities found and the actions needed to resolve them. This section is aimed at a technical level and should include all the necessary information for the technical teams to understand the issue and resolve it. Each finding should be clear and concise and give the reader of the report a full understanding of the issue at hand.

The findings section should include:

Screenshots and command lines to indicate what tasks were undertaken during the execution of the test case
The affected item
A technical description of the issue and the affected function or object
A section on resolving the issue
The severity rating, with vector notation if using CVSS (Industry standard vulnerability severity and risk rankings)
